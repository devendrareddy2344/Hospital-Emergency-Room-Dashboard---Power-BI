# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard - Power BI

## 1. Project Overview

This Power BI project delivers an interactive dashboard designed to analyze and optimize emergency room (ER) performance. It includes three key views: **Monthly View** for trend analysis, **Consolidated View** for aggregated insights, and **Patient Details** for granular data exploration. The dashboard visualizes critical metrics such as patient volume, average wait times, satisfaction scores, and department referrals using sparklines, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps. Developed with DAX calculations and a robust data model, it empowers healthcare stakeholders with data-driven decision-making capabilities.

#### Description
This view displays January 2024 data for 513 patients, featuring an average wait time of 36.3 minutes, a satisfaction score of 4.96, and 214 patient referrals. It includes bar charts for admission status (47.56% not admitted, 52.44% admitted), age distribution, and department referrals, a pie chart for gender (46.98% male, 53.02% female), and a heatmap showing peak hours (e.g., 11-12 PM with 95 patients).

## 2. Project Context

The healthcare sector grapples with challenges in ER efficiency, including prolonged wait times, patient satisfaction, and resource allocation. This project addresses these issues by harnessing Power BI to convert raw ER data into actionable insights. It utilizes a sample dataset spanning 01-04-2023 to 30-10-2024, encompassing 9,216 patient records, to simulate real-world scenarios and lay the groundwork for operational enhancements.

## 3. Project Goals

- Improve ER operational efficiency by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as wait times and patient volume.
- Detect trends and patterns (e.g., peak hours, seasonal variations) to optimize staffing and resource deployment.
- Boost patient satisfaction through timely interventions informed by satisfaction score trends.
- Facilitate detailed troubleshooting with patient-level data to resolve specific operational issues.
- Offer a scalable framework for long-term performance monitoring across customizable date ranges.

## 4. Key Features and Insights

### Key Features
- **Monthly View**: Analyzes daily trends for 513 patients in January 2024.
- **Consolidated View**: Examines 9,216 patients from 01-04-2023 to 30-10-2024.
- **Patient Details**: Provides a detailed table of 20 sample patients with comprehensive metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Features age distribution, gender analysis, and hourly patterns.
- **Interactivity**: Enables dynamic exploration with date range slicers and filters.

### Insights
- **Wait Times**: Averages 35.3-36.3 minutes, with peaks indicating staffing needs during 11-12 PM and 23-24 hours.
- **Admission Status**: Maintains a balanced split (49.96%-52.44% admitted) across views.
- **Timeliness**: Achieves 60-62% of patients seen within 30 minutes, with 38-40% missing the target.
- **Referrals**: Predominantly "None" (5.4K in Consolidated View), with General Practice and Orthopedics as leading categories.
- **Demographics**: Shows a slight female majority (51.05%) and a diverse racial distribution.

#### Description
This view aggregates 9,216 patients from 01-04-2023 to 30-10-2024, with an average wait time of 35.3 minutes, a satisfaction score of 4.99, and 3,816 referrals. It features bar charts for admission status (49.96% not admitted, 50.04% admitted), age groups peaking at 30-39 (1,200 patients), and referrals (5.4K none), a pie chart for gender (48.69% male, 51.05% female), and a heatmap with peaks at 23-24 (1,305 patients).

## 5. Impact of This Project

This dashboard enables healthcare administrators to:
- Reduce wait times by identifying peak periods and adjusting staffing levels.
- Enhance patient satisfaction by linking dips to operational challenges.
- Optimize resource allocation based on referral patterns, such as prioritizing General Practice.
- Improve decision-making with real-time, customizable insights, potentially reducing costs and improving patient outcomes.
- Serve as a replicable model for other healthcare facilities to adopt similar analytics solutions.

## 6. Why This Project

This project tackles the critical need for data-driven ER management in healthcare, where manual analysis is inefficient and prone to errors. Motivated by the rising demand for digital transformation, it leverages Power BIâ€™s interactive tools to address observed inefficiencies in ER operations. The initiative reflects a commitment to using available data to drive meaningful improvements, serving as both a practical application and a valuable learning experience.

## 7. Conclusion

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard represents a successful Power BI implementation, achieving its objectives of enhancing ER efficiency and delivering actionable insights. With its comprehensive visualizations and interactive features, it provides a robust solution for healthcare stakeholders. Future enhancements could involve real-time data integration and predictive analytics to further amplify its impact.

### Image: Patient Details
