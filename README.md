# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard - Power BI

## 1. Project Overview

This Power BI project delivers an interactive dashboard to analyze and optimize emergency room (ER) performance. It comprises three views: **Monthly View** for trend analysis, **Consolidated View** for aggregated insights, and **Patient Details** for granular data exploration. The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as patient volume, average wait times, satisfaction scores, and department referrals using sparklines, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps. Built with DAX calculations and a robust data model, it supports healthcare stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

- Displays January 2024 data for 513 patients with an average wait time of 36.3 minutes and a satisfaction score of 4.96.

## 2. Project Context

The healthcare industry faces challenges in managing ER efficiency, including long wait times, patient satisfaction, and resource allocation. This project was developed to address these issues by leveraging Power BI to transform raw ER data into actionable insights. The dashboard draws from a sample dataset spanning 01-04-2023 to 30-10-2024, reflecting real-world scenarios with 9,216 patient records, providing a foundation for operational improvements.

## 3. Project Goals

- Enhance ER operational efficiency by monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) like wait times and patient volume.
- Identify trends and patterns (e.g., peak hours, seasonal variations) to optimize staffing and resources.
- Improve patient satisfaction through timely interventions based on satisfaction score analysis.
- Enable detailed troubleshooting with patient-level data to address specific operational challenges.
- Provide a scalable solution for long-term performance tracking across customizable date ranges.

## 4. Key Features and Insights

### Key Features
- **Monthly View**: Tracks daily trends for 513 patients in January 2024.
- **Consolidated View**: Analyzes 9,216 patients from 01-04-2023 to 30-10-2024.
- **Patient Details**: Offers a table of 20 sample patients with detailed metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Includes age distribution, gender analysis, and hourly patterns.
- **Interactivity**: Supports dynamic exploration with date range slicers and filters.

### Insights
- **Wait Times**: Average of 35.3-36.3 minutes, with peaks suggesting staffing needs during 11-12 PM and 23-24 hours.
- **Admission Status**: Balanced split (49.96%-52.44% admitted) across views.
- **Timeliness**: 60-62% of patients seen within 30 minutes, with 38-40% missing the target.
- **Referrals**: Dominated by "None" (5.4K in Consolidated View), with General Practice and Orthopedics leading.
- **Demographics**: Slight female majority (51.05%) and diverse racial distribution.

- Aggregates 9,216 patients with a 4.99 satisfaction score and 3,816 referrals.

## 5. Impact of This Project

This dashboard empowers healthcare administrators to:
- Reduce wait times by identifying peak load periods and adjusting staffing.
- Enhance patient satisfaction by correlating dips with operational challenges.
- Optimize resource allocation based on referral trends (e.g., prioritizing General Practice).
- Improve decision-making with real-time, customizable insights, potentially lowering costs and improving patient outcomes.
- Serve as a scalable model for other healthcare facilities to adopt similar analytics.

## 6. Why This Project

The project addresses a critical need in healthcare for data-driven ER management, where manual analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. Inspired by the growing demand for digital transformation in healthcare, it leverages Power BIâ€™s capabilities to provide a user-friendly, interactive tool. The motivation stemmed from observing inefficiencies in ER operations and the potential to use available data to drive meaningful change, making it a valuable learning and practical exercise.

## 7. Conclusion

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is a successful Power BI implementation that meets its goals of enhancing ER efficiency and providing actionable insights. With its comprehensive visualizations and interactive features, it offers a robust solution for healthcare stakeholders. Future enhancements could include real-time data integration and predictive analytics to further elevate its impact.
